# What to know about this setup:
This should include everything in my setup, all configurations of dwm and stuff are in the .config
For the bash theming I used MentalOutlaw's setup, it was the best from what I found online, and I wanted to look somewhat minimalist and not use OhMyBash. It's built off a little bit from MentalOutlaw's setup actually so I don't know why else to use this other than it's really for myself when I need to deploy a new Gentoo setup. But if you do use this, thanks!

If you want to use my custom kernel and make.confs, you might want to poke around in there, I didn't really customize too much so it might be a bit "bloated" for some people. Also for my setup I have a 20HQ Thinkpad X1 Carbon, plus the kernel has the experimental use flag on for support to compile with native, and I have a skylake so I'm not too sure about other Thinkpad models but you can check for yourself.

Also the patches to my dwm that you might like are: systray, fancy active bar, fullscreen, and that's about all I remember lmao

Here is a screenshot of my setup:

Have fun ig.

Some packages that I personally think you might want(?):
urxvt (I use MentalOutLaw's setup), iwd (more minimalist than network manager), doas, perl, vim, pipewire, clipnotify, brightnessctl, xorg (obviously), firefox (I'm pretty sure most people use this already anyways), and uhh yeah that's all I think that might be "needed" for this setup atleast
