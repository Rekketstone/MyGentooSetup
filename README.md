# What to know about this setup:
This should include everything in my setup, all configurations of dwm and stuff are in the .config

If you want to use my custom kernel and make.confs, you might want to poke around in there, I didn't really customize too much so it might be a bit "bloated" for some people.

Also the patches to my dwm that you might like are: systray, fancy active bar, fullscreen, and that'sabout all I remember lmao

Have fun ig.

Some packages:
urxvt, iwd, doas, perl, vim, pipewire, alsa
